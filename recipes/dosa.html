    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Rava dosa (also known as Suji ka Dosa) is a quick and popular variant of dosa from the South Indian cuisine. These are crispy, netted and thin crepes made with semolina (rava or cream of wheat), rice flour, all purpose flour and spices.<br>
        These are incredibly easy to make and require no grinding or fermentation, unlike the traditional Dosa Recipe.

        It is a popular choice, particularly in metro cities for its unique characteristics. Firstly, it is super crisp and carries a thin flaky texture and gives an enjoyable experience when served with spicy chutney or flavored kurma recipes.<br>
        There are many variations to this simple instant dosa recipe, but the texture and taste almost remain the same. Even though this recipe is easy and simple, it needs some simple mandatory tips to be followed for the best results.
